I'm thinking about writing a Multi-User Dungeon (a MUD) using Prolog as the
base language.<p>

Can anyone steer me towards some Prolog adventure game sources? They don't have
to be terribly complicated, and they don't have to be multi-user. <p>

I haven't written one myself, but here are the basic concepts.<p>

1. You need a parser. Write your own lexical analyzer that reads a stream and
returns a list of tokens, such as:<p>
<code>[get,  sword]</code><p>
or whatever. I am using SICStus here.<p>

Convert a stream into a list of lists of characters using the following
predicate:<p>

<pre>
read_from_stream(Stream, CurrList, List_of_lists) :-
	get0(Stream, Char),
	( Char =:= -1 -&gt;  /* end-of-file; you might test for 'return' here */
	 CurrList = [], 
	 List_of_lists = []
	; Char =:= 0' -&gt;  /* space: 0' followed by blank */
	 CurrList = [],
	 List_of_lists = [NextList | Next_list_of_lists],
	 read_from_stream(Stream, NextList, Next_list_of_lists)
	; CurrList = [Char | RestCurrList],
	 read_from_stream(Stream, RestCurrList, List_of_lists)
	).
</pre>

When the input ends (-1 is read), then the current token ends (CurrList = [])
and there is no more to be read (List_of_lists = []). If you read a space, (0'
), the current token ends but there is more to be read. Finally, if a non-eof,
non-blank character is read, put it at the end of the current token and keep
scanning.<p>

Think of it as a very simple state machine: CurrList and List_of_lists
accumulate the inputs and change on a transition (in essence, they are kept as
'pointers to the tails of the lists'). Recursive calls are state transitions
and the base case (when input ends) is an accepting state.<p>

Here is a wrapper predicate you can call:<p>

<pre>
read_list_of_lists(Stream, List_of_lists) :-
  List_of_lists = [Current | Rest],
  read_from_stream(Stream, Current, Rest).
</pre>

You want to use the above to read one token from the stream, convert it into an
atom; then read the next; and so on. Up until the user hits return or the
stream ends. Conversion into atoms can be done using atom_chars/2 . (If your
lexical analysis gets complex, I would recommend you use more sophisticated
methods; such as in O'Keefe's book.)<p>

2. From the list of tokens, you can build a parser using definite clause
grammars:<p>

<pre>
parse_action(get(Object)) --&gt; [get], parse_object(Object).

parse_object(sword) --&gt; [sword] | [chalice].
</pre>

... and so on. Call the parser with action(SyntaxTree,ListOfTokens,[]) and you
get the SyntaxTree in return. If the parser fails, you know there is something
wrong - an unknown token, grammatical errors, etc. You can examine the list or
just print that it is wrong.<p>

3. Once you have a syntax tree, you use an interpreter to implement your
actions. The interpreter takes an action and an old world and returns a new
world.<p>

<pre>
act(get(Object), Old_World, New_World) :-
	( my_location_has_obj(Object, Old_World) -&gt;
	 get_object(Object, Old_World, New_World)
	; interact('object ~q not present.~n',[Object])
	).
...
</pre>

Write a main loop around this:<p>

<pre>
main_loop(Stream, World) :-
  read_list_of_lists(Stream, Tokens),
  ( parse_action(Action, Tokens, []) -&gt;
	 act(Action, World, NewWorld)
  ; syntax_error(Tokens),
	 World = NewWorld
  ),
  main_loop(Stream, NewWorld).
</pre>

You will have to extend the above to detect when the stream ends, print the
score, or save the world state to a file.<p>

4. You have to implement the world, which is being passed around. If the
structure of your world is more or less fixed, then implement rooms, their
connections and descriptions as a database:

<pre>
room_description(5,'a featureless plain').
...
room_connects(5, North, East, West, South) :-
	North = 5, East = 5, West = 5, South = 5.
...
</pre>

Objects are moved around and changing, so make a dictionary mapping object
names to locations. (Or object ID:s, or what have you.) <p>

The World can now be implemented as a term:<p>

<code>world(MyLocation, MyObjects, WorldObjects)</code><p>

When you move, make a new term with a changed MyLocation:<p>

<pre>
change_location(New_loc, Old_world, New_world) :-
	Old_world = world(_Old_loc, MyObj, WorldObj),
	New_world = world(New_loc, MyObj, WorldObj).
</pre>

When you get something, make a new WorldObjects without the thing and put it in
MyObjects; when you drop it, do the other way around. An easy data structure
for the dictionary is binary trees with two nodes:<p>

leaf<p>
tree(Left_sub_tree, Key, Value, Right_sub_tree)<p>

Deleting something from the tree means making a new tree where that Key/Value
pair does not appear. Insertion means making a new tree where the Key/Value
pair <i>does</i> appear. Updating ... you get the picture.<p>

I would advice you to avoid assert/retract as far as possible, since they are
horrible and pretty slow. (I say this because it seems to be an instinct of
Prolog programmers to use the damn things! And I don't want any readers to get
the wrong idea about how to do this.)<p>

5. If you want to write a MUD, it will have to be able to accept multiple
concurrent users. A very simple way of doing it is to have the main_loop read
from several streams and parse several things at once. When one user has formed
a token stream, you can run that action through the interpreter, update the
world and carry on without any complex schemes to keep the world consistent
when there are multiple updates. It might not work well when there are a lot of
users, though; and you need some way to poll streams.<p>

Well, that is more or less it. Not very sophisticated, but I think you can
extend the grammar, interpreter, world, etc. pretty easily. <p>

I recommend Richard A. O'Keefe's <i>The Craft of Prolog</i> as a good book to
get to know how to <i>program</i> in Prolog. <p>

Here is the start of a news article by Dennis Merritt I've used the code, not
especially endorsed, as a starting point for a student project for an
undergraduate AI class. It works reasonably well. <p>

PCAI reprint of "Exploring Prolog Adventures, Objects, Animals, and Taxes"<br>
5th December 1993<p>

This article was originally published in <i>PC AI magazine</i>, Volume 7,
Number 5 September/October 1993. The magazine can be reached at: <p>

Tel +1 602 971 1869<br>
Fax: +1 602 971 2321<br>
</pre>

The article is an introduction to Prolog, which attempts to bring out the
practical benefits of its technical features (e.g. unification, backtracking),
rather than its theoretical basis.<p>

While I have written a number of "useful" Prolog programs since, I was first
drawn to Prolog while I was in the middle of writing, for fun, an adventure
game in C on my first "personal" computer. I had started my C program by
building the basic tools needed for the game, which included a dynamic database
to record the changing state of the game, and the ability to search for
symbolic patterns in the state that indicated some action needed to be taken.
The action was usually represented by a message to the user and a change of
state of the game. The article is available from:<p>

There is also my book:<p>
<pre>
<i>Adventure in Prolog</i>
Springer-Verlag
ISBN 0-387-97315-X, ISBN 3-540-97315-X
</pre>

It teaches Prolog through the use of an extended example application, which is
an adventure game.<p>

It has an implementation of the game without asserts and retracts to illustrate
a 'pure' Prolog approach to the problem, but the primary version uses them.
While I understand the aversion many Prolog programmers have to
asserts/retracts (which is basically the same argument that can be made against
global variables, a constant source of error in conventional programming
languages), I must confess that I find using the dynamic database for the state
of an adventure game a very natural solution. <p>
