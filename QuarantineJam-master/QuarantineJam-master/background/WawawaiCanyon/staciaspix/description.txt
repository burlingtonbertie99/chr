Annie -- here are some pics.  I have difficulty seeing what is in the thumbnails, so hope these may help the visuals for the game.  One pic I think I am sending is an insect trap hanging in the vineyard.  Lots of threats are coming including the spot-winged Drosophila, glassy-winged sharpshooter, and Phylloxera, which attacks roots.  In the winery, fermentation takes place in those big bins, and fruit flies, just the ordinary ones, bring acetobactor organisms that turn wine to vinegar.  We use turkeys to combat grasshoppers...Mildew attacks the vines if they are overly leafy and ruins the fruit.  Hope this is enough hazards.  There's also gophers which attack roots and deer that consume the vines.
Good luck!
